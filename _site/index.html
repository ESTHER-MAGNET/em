        <h3>Hospital Partnership MAGNET</h3>
        <h4>Malawi German Networking for Capacity Building in Treatment, Training and Research
at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), Lilongwe, Malawi</h4>
        <p>The partnership started in 2008 and is funded as part of the German ESTHER Initiative through GIZ. The current third phase runs until October 2015.
The partnership has accompanied the KCH through various periods of extreme staff shortages and always put the improving of care at the centre of its efforts with the overall aim: Clinical care and managerial capacity of the Medical Department of Kamuzu Central Hospital is strengthened. Every year an annual departmental planning meeting looks at the status and progress of the partnership next to regular visits by German partners.
The hospital partnership is between the Kamuzu Central Hospital in Malawi, Africa, the University Hospital in Heidelberg, Germany, and the University Hospital Cologne, Germany.

During the current phase the partners focus on three subcomponents, which are described in a bit more details. For all subcomponents the MD has identified a Malawian clinician to take on particular responsibilities.</p> 
        <h3>Currently three subcomponents</h3>
        <ol class="bordered-list" type="1">
          <li></li>
           <li> <h4>E-learning as a Tool for Partial Compensation for Lack of Clinical Teachers </h4></li>
          <p>The scarcity of senior medical doctors impairs the learning opportunities for interns, especially during their vital internship-year. Improving the quality of education during the internship is pivotal in order to sustain good quality of treatment and care. The rationale of the e-learning platform is to improve the quality of patient care and in service training in the medical department of the KCH. </p>
          <li></li>
          <li><h4>Antibiotic Stewardship Initiative at the KCH</h4></li>
          <p>Infectious diseases present a major challenge for health services worldwide, particularly in resource limited settings. Prevention and efficient treatment of severe infections are essential in order to improve neonatal/under-five mortality, maternal health and the outcomes of patients infected with HIV.</p><p>Good hospital infection control practices can help to contain the development of antibiotic resistance but can be a particular challenge in resource limited settings. The overall objective is to survey the epidemiology of bloodstream infections and their antibiotic resistance pattern in order to improve clinical decision making in infectious disease and to promote rational use and management of anti-infective medicines.</p>
          <li></li>
          <li><h4>Assessment and Evaluation of Diabetes Care</h4></li>
          <p>Diabetes mellitus ranks among the top ten causes of disability worldwide and has become a serious health problem in many low and middle- income countries. </p>
          <p>The Diabetes Clinic at KCH has seen an enormous increase in demand and utilization by patients over the last years reaching around 2000 registered patients. The Medical department staff felt likewise increasingly unhappy with the current situation, patient load and limited resources for management. Therefore within the MAGNET partnership together with KCH’s partners from the Pittsburgh University is was agreed to conduct a cross-sectional descriptive study is to assess patient’s knowledge, attitude, practice, quality of life and health status at the diabetic clinic.</p>
