        <h3>Hospital Partnership MAGNET</h3>
        <h4>Malawi German Networking for Capacity Building in Treatment, Training and Research
at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH), Lilongwe, Malawi</h4>
        <p>The partnership started in 2008 and is funded as part of the German ESTHER Initiative through GIZ. The current third phase runs until October 2015.
The partnership has accompanied KCH through various periods of extreme staff shortages and always put the improving of care at the centre of its efforts with the overall aim: Clinical care and managerial capacity of the Medical Department of Kamuzu Central Hospital is strengthened. Every year an annual departmental planning meeting looks at the status and progress of the partnership next to regular visits by German partners.
The funding through GIZ has been very supportive however for the current phase the overall conditions for the German partners have become increasingly difficult.
During the current phase the partners focus on three subcomponents, which are described in a bit more details. For all subcomponents the MD has identified a Malawian clinician to take on particular responsibilities.</p>
